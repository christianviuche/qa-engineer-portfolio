# 15: Monitoring & Observability

In modern software engineering, **QA does not end at deployment.**

**Monitoring** allows us to understand how the application behaves in the "real world" (Production). It is the process of collecting data to answer the question: *"Is the system healthy?"*

**Observability** goes deeper, allowing us to use that data to answer: *"Why is the system acting this way?"*

## Key Tools & Concepts

### 1. APM (Application Performance Monitoring) 📉

Tools that monitor the "heartbeat" of the application: speed, latency, and error rates.

* **New Relic:** <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/newrelic/8C00FF" alt="New Relic logo" width="18" height="18" valign="middle">
    * **Use:** Provides a deep X-ray of your application code. It tells you exactly which function or database query is slowing down the website.
* **Datadog:** <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/datadog/8C00FF" alt="Datadog logo" width="18" height="18" valign="middle">
    * **Use:** An all-in-one observability platform. It monitors servers, clouds, apps, and logs in one dashboard. It is a primary competitor to New Relic.

### 2. Log Management & Visualization 📊

Logs are the comprehensive records of events ("diaries") generated by the server.

* **Kibana (part of ELK Stack):** <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/kibana/8C00FF" alt="Kibana logo" width="18" height="18" valign="middle">
    * **Use:** The visualization layer for Elasticsearch. It lets you search through millions of log lines instantly and create charts (e.g., "Show me how many 404 errors happened yesterday").
* **Grafana:** <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/grafana/8C00FF" alt="Grafana logo" width="18" height="18" valign="middle">
    * **Use:** The industry standard for open-source visualization. It takes data from anywhere (Prometheus, SQL, AWS) and turns it into beautiful, real-time dashboards.

### 3. Error Tracking 🐞

Tools specifically designed to catch "crashes" that users experience.

* **Sentry:** <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/sentry/8C00FF" alt="Sentry logo" width="18" height="18" valign="middle">
    * **Use:** When a user's app crashes, Sentry captures the exact error, the line of code, and the user's device info, and alerts the developers immediately.

### 4. Incident Response 🚨

* **PagerDuty:** <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/pagerduty/8C00FF" alt="PagerDuty logo" width="18" height="18" valign="middle">
    * **Use:** The "alarm system." When Datadog or New Relic detects a critical failure (e.g., "Checkout is down"), PagerDuty wakes up the on-call engineer (via phone call/SMS) to fix it.

### 5. API Monitoring 📡

* **RunScope:**
    * **Use:** Specializes in monitoring APIs. It runs automated tests against your public APIs continuously to ensure they are up and returning the correct data.
