# Christian's QA Learning Journey

Welcome to my Quality Assurance (QA) portfolio. This repository documents my learning journey as I explore the core concepts of QA engineering, starting with the fundamentals.

This project is inspired by the QA Roadmap and the "Curso Completo de QA Engineer" on Udemy. All notes, summaries, and code are my own.
