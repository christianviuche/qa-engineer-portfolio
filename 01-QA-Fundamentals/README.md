# 01: QA Fundamentals - The Core Concepts

This section covers the foundational concepts of quality in software development. It's crucial to understand the difference between Quality Assurance (QA), Quality Control (QC), and Testing.

## Concept Definitions

### 1. Quality Assurance (QA)

QA is a broad, **proactive process** designed to **prevent** defects. It focuses on improving the *entire* software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure quality is "built-in" from the start.

* **Goal:** To prevent defects and improve processes.
* **Orientation:** Proactive 🛡️
* **Answers:** "Are we building the product the *right way*?"
* **Examples:**
    * Defining coding standards.
    * Performing code reviews.
    * Choosing the right tools.
    * Creating a test strategy.

### 2. Quality Control (QC)

QC is a **reactive process** designed to **detect** defects. It focuses on verifying the *product* itself to ensure it meets the defined quality standards and requirements.

* **Goal:** To find defects and verify functionality.
* **Orientation:** Reactive 🔍
* **Answers:** "Did we build the *right product*?"
* **Examples:**
    * Executing test cases (Testing).
    * Reviewing test results.
    * Reporting bugs.
    * Inspecting the final product.

### 3. Testing

Testing is the **specific activity** of executing a test to find bugs. It is a subset of Quality Control (QC). You can't have QC without testing.

* **Goal:** To find and report bugs.
* **Orientation:** Execution ⚙️
* **Answers:** "Does this specific part work as expected?"
* **Examples:**
    * Running a login test script.
    * Trying to break a form.
    * Checking a button's functionality.

## QA vs. QC: At a Glance

This table is a great way to summarize the key differences.

| Feature | Quality Assurance (QA) | Quality Control (QC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | **Process** | **Product** |
| **Goal** | Defect **Prevention** | Defect **Detection** |
| **Orientation** | Proactive (Preventivo) | Reactive (Detectivo) |
| **When?** | Throughout the entire SDLC | During and after development |
| **Example** | Code Reviews, Defining Standards | Executing Test Cases, Bug Reporting |

## The QA Mindset

The "QA Mindset" is a specific way of thinking. It's a set of soft skills and attitudes that go beyond technical knowledge.

It's about having:

* **Constructive Curiosity:** Always asking "What if...?"
* **Empathy for the User:** Being the primary advocate for the end-user.
* **A "Constructively Destructive" View:** Thinking of all the creative ways to break the software.
* **Attention to Detail:** Noticing the small things others might miss.
* **Systems Thinking:** Understanding the "big picture" and how all the pieces connect.
